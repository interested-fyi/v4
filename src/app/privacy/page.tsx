        Personal Information:
        <br />
        Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell,
        trade, rent, or otherwise share for marketing purposes your Personal
        Information with third parties without your consent. We do share
        Personal Information with vendors who are performing services for the
        Company, such as the servers for our email communications who are
        provided access to user’s email address for purposes of sending emails
        from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our
        direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

      <p>
        In general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help
        us communicate with you. For example, we use Personal Information to
        contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback from users,
        provide technical support, and inform users about promotional offers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a
        good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the
        information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal process
        or enforceable governmental request; to enforce applicable Terms of
        Service, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud,
        security, or technical concerns; or to protect against harm to the
        rights, property, or safety of our users or the public as required or
        permitted by law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-Personal Information:
        <br />
        In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the
        Service and customize the user experience. We also aggregate
        Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use
        patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way our
        use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right
        to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners,
        advertisers, and other third parties at our discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger,
        acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our
        assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred.
        You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are
        permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets
        may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this
        Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at any time in the
        future, we will post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt
        out of the new information practices. We suggest that you check the Site
        periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.
      </p>
      <h2>III. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        We implement security measures designed to protect your information from
        unauthorized access. Your account is protected by your account password
        and we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by
        not disclosing your password and by logging out of your account after
        each use. We further protect your information from potential security
        breaches by implementing certain technological security measures
        including encryption, firewalls, and secure socket layer technology.
        However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not
        be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such
        firewalls and secure server software. By using our Service, you
        acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.

      <p>
        You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for
        marketing purposes. When we send a promotional communication to a user,
        the user can opt out of further promotional communications by following
        the unsubscribe instructions provided in each promotional e-mail. You
        can also indicate that you do not wish to receive marketing
        communications from us in the [list location of opt-out page, i.e.
        “Settings” section] of the Site. Please note that notwithstanding the
        promotional preferences you indicate by either unsubscribing or opting
