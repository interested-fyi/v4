        arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you and the Company

        <b>Informal Dispute Resolution. </b>There might be instances when a
        Dispute arises between you and Company. If that occurs, Company is
        committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and
        Company agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can
        result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and
        Company therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration
        against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a
        party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or
        via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any
        Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“
        <b>Informal Dispute Resolution Conference</b>”). If you are represented
        by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will
        also participate in the conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>
          The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in
          writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution
          Conference (“
        </span>
        <b>
          <span>Notice</span>
        </b>
        <span>
          ”), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives
          such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the
          parties. Notice to Company that you intend to initiate an Informal
          Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to:{" "}
        </span>

        , <span>Fountain Hills,</span>
        <span>Arizona</span>
        <span>
          85268. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number,
          mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you
          have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail
          address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your
          Dispute.

        <span>
          The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized
          such that a separate conference must be held each time either party
          initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms
          represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree;
          multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the
          same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.
          In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal
          Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement
          shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to
          resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal
          Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement
          that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of

        interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with
        respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act,
        9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of
        this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If the
        Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve
        satisfactorily within 60 days after receipt of your Notice, you and
        Company agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve
        the Dispute through binding arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act
        governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration
        Agreement. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established
        alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and
        counterclaims with an amount in controversy under $250,000, not
        inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’
        most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures
        available at<span>&nbsp;</span>
        <span>http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</span>; all
        other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the
        Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at
        <span>&nbsp;</span>
        <span>http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</span>.
        JAMS’s rules are also available at<span>&nbsp;</span>
        <span>www.jamsadr.com</span>or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. A party
        who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a
        request for arbitration (the “<b>Request</b>”). The Request must
        include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address
        of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if
        applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable
        account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the
        factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought
        and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in
        United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the
        Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence
        that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in
        connection with such arbitration.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the
        Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing
        address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By
        signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s
        knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable
        under the circumstances, that: (1) the Request is not being presented
        for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or
        needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims,
        defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by
        a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing
        law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual and damages
        contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified,
        will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for
        further investigation or discovery.

          Unless you and Company otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration
          process discussed in Subsection 10.2(h) is triggered, the arbitration
          will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the JAMS
          Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of
          information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature
          of the arbitration. If the JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the

        IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE
        ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
        Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award
        declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
        seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
        warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is

        Subsection<span>10.2(h) </span>entitled “Batch Arbitration.”
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement,
        if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any
        further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this subsection,
        “Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief,” are invalid or
        unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a
        request for public injunctive relief), you and Company agree that that
        particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim
        or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be
        litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of
        Arizona. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small
        claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or Company from
        participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

        right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary

        (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after
        the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining
        Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide
        for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration
        with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch,
        one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be

          scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same
          or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the
          application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party

        <b>Entire Terms.</b> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between
        you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or
        enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a
        waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are
        for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word
        “including” means “including without limitation”.&nbsp; If any provision
        of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable,
        the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid
        or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid
        and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.&nbsp; Your
        relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and
        neither party is an agent or partner of the other.&nbsp; These Terms,
